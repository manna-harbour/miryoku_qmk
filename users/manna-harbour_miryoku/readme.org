[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/cover/miryoku-kle-cover.png]]

[[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/][Miryoku]] is an ergonomic, minimal, orthogonal, and universal keyboard layout.  [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku][Miryoku QMK]] is the Miryoku implementation for [[https://qmk.fm][QMK]].

** Branches


*** QMK master

Miryoku QMK is periodically merged upstream into QMK master and it is generally recommended to build directly from QMK master.

QMK master is at https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master, and the corresponding Miryoku QMK readme is at https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/users/manna-harbour_miryoku.


*** Miryoku QMK development branch

The Miryoku QMK development branch is ~miryoku~ and may contain new commits not yet merged into QMK master.

~miryoku~ is at https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku, and the corresponding Miryoku QMK readme is at https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/tree/miryoku/users/manna-harbour_miryoku.

New commits can be seen at the top of the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk/commits/miryoku][history]] with commit messages beginning ~[miryoku]~.  After the new commits are squashed and merged upstream into QMK master by pull request the ~miryoku~ branch is renamed and a new ~miryoku~ branch is created from QMK master.

To checkout the ~miryoku~ branch in your existing QMK build environment:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
git remote add miryoku_qmk git@github.com:manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk.git # if using SSH
git remote add miryoku_qmk https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_qmk.git # if using HTTPS
git fetch miryoku_qmk
git checkout --track miryoku_qmk/miryoku
#+END_SRC


** Building


*** Local Builds

First [[https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started][set up the QMK build environment and build the default keymap for your keyboard]].

Then build with ~manna-harbour_miryoku~ as the keymap name as follows.


**** qmk

Build with the ~qmk~ command.  E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
qmk compile -c -kb crkbd -km manna-harbour_miryoku # build for crkbd
qmk flash -c -kb crkbd -km manna-harbour_miryoku # build for crkbd and flash
#+END_SRC

To select alternative layouts, use the ~-e~ option. E.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
qmk compile -c -kb crkbd -km manna-harbour_miryoku -e MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY -e MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT -e MIRYOKU_CLIPBOARD=WIN -e MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP # build for crkbd with alternative layouts
#+END_SRC


**** make

First ~cd~ to the repository root.  Then build with ~make~. E.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make clean crkbd:manna-harbour_miryoku # build for crkbd
make clean crkbd:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash # build for crkbd and flash
#+END_SRC

To select alternative layouts, append to the command line. E.g.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make clean crkbd:manna-harbour_miryoku MIRYOKU_ALPHAS=QWERTY MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT MIRYOKU_CLIPBOARD=WIN MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP # build for crkbd with alternative layouts
#+END_SRC


*** Workflow Builds

Firmware can be built via GitHub Actions workflows without use of a local build environment.  Local tools are still required for [[https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_flashing][flashing]].

First log in to GitHub, fork the [[#miryoku-qmk-development-branch][Miryoku QMK development branch]] repository, and enable workflows.

To access a workflow, visit the Actions tab and select the workflow.  To download the firmware from a workflow run, select the workflow, select the workflow run, select the desired Artifacts, and unzip the downloaded zip file.

Workflow files are in [[../../.github/workflows]].


**** Build Examples

Copy one of the included Build Example workflow files, edit the ~name~ value, and edit and add options and values as desired.  Select Run workflow, select the Branch if desired, and activate Run workflow.

Options are specified in the ~with~ section and are of the following form.
: option: '["value"]'

For multiple values per option use the following form, and a matrix build will be performed for each combination of values across all options.
: option: '["value1","value2"]'

The ~keyboard~ option specifies the keyboard and is required.  All other options are optional.

The ~alphas~, ~nav~, ~clipboard~, and ~layers~ options correspond to the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#alternative-layouts][alternative layout]] options.  The ~mapping~ option corresponds to the alternative [[#subset-mapping][mapping]] options.  Alternative layout and mapping options are given in the documentation in the form ~MIRYOKU_OPTION=VALUE~.  To use here, convert to the form specified above.  Use ~default~ to represent the default value.  Values for these five options are case-insensitive.  See the [[../../.github/workflows/test-all-configs.yml][Test All Configs workflow file]] for all supported values.

The ~rules~ and ~config~ options can be used to specify values to be appended to ~custom_rules.mk~ and ~custom_config.h~, respectively.  Separate multiple lines with ~\n~.


**** Build Inputs

The Build Inputs workflow can be used without editing workflow files.  Select Run workflow, select the Branch and fill out the form as desired, and activate Run workflow.

Options are specified by entering values directly in the corresponding field.  Multiple comma separated values can be entered per option and a matrix build will be performed for each combination of values across all options.

The ~Keyboard~ option specifies the keyboard and is required.  All other options are optional.

The ~Miryoku Alphas~, ~Miryoku Nav~, ~Miryoku Clipboard~, and ~Miryoku Layers~ options correspond to the [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#alternative-layouts][alternative layout]] options.  The ~Miryoku Mapping~ option corresponds to the alternative [[#subset-mapping][mapping]] options.  Alternative layout and mapping options are given in the documentation in the form ~MIRYOKU_OPTION=VALUE~.  To use here, enter the ~value~ in the corresponding ~Miryoku Option~ field.  Use ~default~ to represent the default value.  Values for these five options are case-insensitive.

The ~custom_rules.mk~ and ~custom_config.h~ options can be used to specify values to be appended to the corresponding files.  Join multiple lines with ~\n~.


** Subset Mapping

The keymap, build options, and configuration are shared between keyboards.  The
layout is mapped onto keyboards with different physical layouts as a subset
without code duplication using the QMK userspace feature and C macros.


*** Userspace

The keymap is defined for ~LAYOUT_miryoku~ which is 10x4, with the outer 2
positions on the bottom row unused and the rest of the bottom row being the
thumb keys.

- [[./rules.mk]] :: Build options.  Automatically included.

- [[./custom_rules.mk]] :: Add Miryoku ~make~ options here to set defaults for all builds.  Included from ~rules.mk~.

- [[./post_rules.mk]] :: Handles Miryoku ~make~ options.  Included from ~rules.mk~.

- [[./config.h]] :: Config options.  Automatically included.

- [[./custom_config.h]] :: Add custom config options here.  Included from ~config.h~.

- [[./manna-harbour_miryoku.h]] :: Keymap-related definitions.  Included from ~manna-harbour_miryoku.c~.

Layer data is generated by [[https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_babel][Miryoku Babel]] and is included from files in the [[miryoku_babel]] directory.

- [[./manna-harbour_miryoku.c]] :: Contains the keymap.  Added from ~rules.mk~.


*** Community Layouts

To use the keymap on a keyboard supporting the community layouts feature,
~LAYOUT_miryoku~ is defined as a macro mapping onto the layout's own ~LAYOUT~
macro, leaving the unused keys as ~KC_NO~.

For keyboards supporting multiple layouts for which subset mappings are
available, select the layout with ~FORCE_LAYOUT~ in the ~make~ command line when
building.  E.g.:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make planck/rev6:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash FORCE_LAYOUT=planck_mit # planck_mit
make planck/rev6:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash FORCE_LAYOUT=ortho_4x12 # ortho_4x12
#+END_SRC


**** 60_ansi

An angled ortho split layout is mapped onto the row-staggered keyboard.  The
rows are moved up to better position the thumb keys, the hands are separated as
much as possible, and the left hand column angle is reversed to reduce ulnar
deviation of the wrists.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-60_ansi.png]]

An alternative subset mapping is also provided without reverse column angle.  To
select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=NOREVERSEANGLE~ to the ~make~
command line when building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-60_ansi-noreverseangle.png]]

Another alternative subset mapping is provided mapping only the 3x10 alphas,
plus spacebar for space / Nav, with the remainder being the default 60_ansi
keymap with semicolon in place of quote. To select this mapping, append
~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=LITE~ to the ~make~ command line when building.

make dz60:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash MIRYOKU_MAPPING=LITE  # dz60, with lite mapping
#+END_SRC


**** ergodox

For the ergodox layout, the main 5x3 alphas are used as usual. The primary and
secondary thumb keys are the inner and outer 2u thumb keys and the tertiary
thumb key is the innermost key of the partial bottom row.  The remaining keys
are unused.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ergodox.png]]

Keyboards supporting this layout: ergodone, ergodox_ez, ergodox_infinity, hotdox.

Example build command lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make ergodox_infinity:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash # ergodox_infinity
make ergodox_ez:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash # ergodox_ez
#+END_SRC


**** ortho_4x10

An alternative with 180 degree rotation is also provided to enable the USB cable to be relocated for use with laptops.  To select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=ROTATE~ to the ~make~ command line when building.

Keyboards supporting this layout: newgame40, nimrod, marksard/rhymestone, pabile/p40.

Example build command lines:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle no
make marksard/rhymestone:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash # marksard/rhymestone
make pabile/p40:manna-harbour_miryoku:flash MIRYOKU_MAPPING=ROTATE # pabile/p40, rotate
#+END_SRC


**** ortho_4x12

For the ortho_4x12 layout, the middle two columns, and the 2 keys on each end of
the bottom row are unused.  This allows the hands to be positioned without ulnar
deviation of the wrists.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ortho_4x12.png]]

For split keyboards using this layout the halves can be positioned and rotated
for each hand and so an alternative mapping is provided.  The right half is as
follows: The rightmost column bottom 3 keys is the pinkie column.  The middle 4
columns top 3 rows are for the remaining fingers.  The pinkie column is one row
lower than the other columns to provide some column stagger.  The bottom row
left 3 keys are the thumb keys.  The remaining keys are unused.  To select this
mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=SPLIT~ to the ~make~ command line when
building.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/master/data/mapping/miryoku-kle-mapping-ortho_4x12-split.png]]

An alternative with extended thumb position but without pinkie column stagger is
also provided.  To select this mapping, append ~MIRYOKU_MAPPING=EXTENDED_THUMBS~
to the ~make~ command line when building.
